Please note: The underlined variant is recently not being maintained because 
its concept doesnt seem to be sofware-technically reliable and because of lack of interest.

Changes to version 2.9 (unreleased) regular(-) & italic(/) & capitals (C) (20080619)
- There was a compiling-problem with the LinLibertine_Re-2.8.14.otf that caused a unusable GSUB-table. Though outline-information seemed to be unaffected MacOSX didn’t want to intall it. This version should be without this bug, the reason for the old bug could not be discovered.
- Change in the OpenType-Substitution table (different order of interpretation: sups and sinf should be substituted even if oldstyle flag is also set.
/ True Cyrrillic italics for the italic variant
/ new “a” for the italic, also thinner p, n, m and e
/ Some stylistic improvements for italic numbers
/ new @ for the italic
- further kerning
/ improved accented characters in the italic variant 
- Q’s tail is now more harmonic and looks as drawn out of the O and not as just clipped to the bottom
- Qu (Q_u) has been improved and is now standard ligature
- new form for s_t- and c_t-ligature, Thanks to Nathan!
- OpenType-GSUB-table has been improved. New functionality for Romanian and Moldavian (comma-accent instead of cedilla), for Turky (idotaccent.sc is chosen when Tyrkish is default language, otherwiese i.sc is the small capital form used; f_i_()-ligatures are set off in Turkish because it hinders the differenciation of f-i and f-dotlessi in that language.
/ Italic variant now uses the same perfect OpenType-GSUB as the regular.
/ new a.sc for the italic. Adding missing sc-glyphs, bring others to the latest design.

Changes to version 2.7.9 regular(|) & italic(/) & capitals (20071228)
- new Hinting! Now it is possible to use Libertine with Word on Windows properly. The shape on screen should be clearer now on every system!
- new kern pairs for better typography
- some wrong contour directions corrected
- many small corrections
- OT "fina" has been removed from wordend-sigma
- countless small improvements
- kerning for Caps variant
- the conflict (that came up lately with a library update) between underlined and regular is diminished


Changes to version 2.6.9 regular(|) & italic(/) & capitals (20070423)

Gernerally: 
	- Symbols for „page“, „graph“, „picture“ and „table“ added
	- Oldstyle numbers (minuscle numbers) were just contained as proportionals. Somebody wanted them also as table numbers. Ladder became standard oldstyles now. Some of these glyphs look somewhat thinner to fit them on the fixed width.
	-bold italic variant had a wrong style entry which seemed to confuse Mac's fonthandling, also other style confusions should be fixed now
	-bold italic also had wrong metrics which resulted in a cutoff of glyph parts and wrong line spacing.

German interests:
	-großes Eszett hinzugefügt (uni1E9E) entsprechend Kapitälchen-Eszett
	-kleines Eszett so verändert, dass es zum großen passt (ſz statt  ſs), das vorige Eszett ist als germandbls.alt weiterenthalten
	-Im Stilsatz ss03 kann für Schweizer nun automatisch von Eszetts auf ss umgestellt werden.
	-die dt. ÄÖÜ sind nun von der Alternativposition an die rechte Stelle gerückt. Für die nichtdeutschsprachige Nutzung empfehlen sich jetzt die (vormals standart, jetzt aber auf die Alternativposition gewechselten Akzentuierten)

Cyrillic:
	Due to A. Panovs help hopefully a lot of design impriovements for the cyrrilic alphabet. 
	Mainly: Є Љ Њ Б З Ф Ш Щ Ъ Ы Ь Э Ю Ө (and its small letter derivates) For details:
		("Ь" in regular typeface has extra contour at left bottom.)
		--corrected--

		Lower part of "Ь" and "Ъ" (and for lowercase letters "ь", "ы", "ъ",
		"ѣ") differ. I think the letter "Ь" (or "ь" for lowercase) should be
		used as base for others.

		("Ф" is still slightly asymmetric with respect to vertical axis. It may produce artefacts with rendering.)
		--corrected--

		(Middle vertical stems in "Ш", "Щ" have not rounded lower edges.)
		--corrected--

		("Ш", "ш" are not quite symmetric agains middle vertical axis (all
		typefaces). "Щ", "щ" must be updated accordingly.)
		--corrected--

		(The tongue in "Э" can have two stylistic variants: straight and
		tilde-like. )
		OK, then tilde-like.

		(The designer decides which version should be selected. Some other letters should follow this decision: U+0472, U+04E8, U+0404, etc.)
		--corrected--

		(The capital letters U+0472 and U+04E8 usually are identical, excepting the case of archaic (before ca. XVIII century) form of U+0472.) 
		--corrected--

		(The U+0473 frequently is narrower than "o" and U+04E9. In case of a tilde-tongue in "Э" a tongue in U+0404 is not flipped, i.e. it has the same diriction as in "Э".)
		--corrected--

Small Caps:
	- Some changes here for better spacing.
	- FO-overlap (due to wrong kerning entry) removed

Bolded:
	- Complete revision of the bold version. Should result in a clearer shape and better thin-width-contrast

OpenType: 
	- Due to better support in the FontForge editor the OpenType-tables have been completely redefined.



Changes to version 2.5.9 regular(|) & italic(/) & capitals (20070423)
- countless improvements as usual
- some unicode standard optimizations (NUL-glyph, .notdef, ...)
- U+0180 group of charakters were sometimes not the way the latest unicode wants them so we changed them. This refers mainly to the differentiation of capital and small letters
- Vietnamese horned vokals have been changed the way, that the horn is now always at the same hight. All accented vietnamese glyphs were revised
- some optic improvements in placement of accents
- added a capital variant of hookabove and changed all the capital letters to this new hookabove form. It is wider and lower for better line-holding
- kerning was greatly improved, i.e.: Kombinations like "f)", "f?", "(j"... shouldn't overlap anymore. Capital letter words should now be better spaced.
- There was one wrong cyrrilic letter Lje (U+0409). 
And there were some correct objections to the handling of the downgoing serif in Dzhe/dzhe, De/de, Tse/tse, Shcha/shcha. These now have the same depth and similar form
- Some small changes in cyrrilics most complex letter Zhe 
but also in Ef 
in the hardening and softening signs (should not look like a reversed P but like the bud of the B), 
Ya shouldn't look like a flipped R, 
be had a too right tail, 
breve.cyr didn't look cyrrillic enough, 
ef shouldn't be too calligraphic, 
dje/she have now x-hight-bars
- due to a bug U+1fc7 (an accented eta) was missing
- some eagled-eyed person had seen that the U+721 was not at its place
- perthousandzero added at U+E00E for full LaTex-support
- some accented smallcaps added to basic font table for LaTex-support (This doesn't affect the Caps-version of Libertine, which already had all these glyphs)
- removed a cyrrilic opentype entry that substituted N-o with the numberligature because a stupid GNOME environment read out this table entry on a Spanish system and messed up typography...


Changes to version 2.4.9 regular(|) & italic(/) & capitals (20070309)
- many countless improvements
- some letters are slimer now: a, k, c, r
this is especially useful for languages with longs words. German in the first place...
- on screen letters with round parts should now look more equal on screen
-C, D, G, S have now better (shorter) serifs which are more useful for the standart printing size of 12-10pt
- the thinnest line should now have a width of at least 50 (improvements for 12-10pt printing)
- the whole range from U+180 -> U+01BF has been reworked
-small improvements in the IPA-Extensions
-for better acception of the old greek we changed the inverted breve to a tilde which is more widely used..., accents also have received some improvements
-The cyrillic alphabeth has had again great changes due to unsatisfied users. We now have more equal cyrillic serifs, some letters are thinner some wider, spacing has been renewed
-p,i have now horizontal serifs in the cyrillic
-the bold regular is greatly improved. It's now fatter, looks more elegant
- the curive has also improvements:
   J is now better
   many things are corresponding to the improvements in the regular
-improvements in the capital variant

Changes to version 2.3.2regular(|) & italic(/) & capitals (20060920)
Countless improvements...
-especially for the italic, the kyrillic
-polish accents ogonki are now what they should be
-new: hebrew alphabeth
-numbers
-accents brought to one hight (some dotted chars weren't)
-Same hight for capitals (already one point difference can the letter look higher on screen. For print this doesn't play any role...
-superior/inferior numbers improved
-ae looks now different: mor organic. If you don't like this. Theres also an old variant at the end of the font
-ij ligature isn't connected anymore 
-greek accented chars improved (accents should now be optically at the same position), kappa improved
-planet signs added
-Sternkreiszeichen hinzugefügt
-male, female,... improved

-----------Fertig-nach Tobias Vorschlägen----------------------------
02C4 (MODIFIER LETTER UP ARRORHEAD), * raised articulation (-> 005E ^
circumflex accent, 2303 ^ up arrowhead). Siehe
http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U02B0.pdf
Wenn ich in die PDF-Datei schaue, sehen 02C2 (<), 02C3 (>), 02C4 (^) und
02C4 (v) größer aus als 02C4 (^) und 02C5 (v). Vielleicht sollte man für
02C2 bis 02C3 einfach ein gedrehtes '<' benutzen?
- Zeichenbreite im Block "SPACE MODIFIER LETTERS (02B0–02FF)"
(http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U02B0.pdf) ist zum Teil verkehrt.
Diese Zeichen sollen alle eine endliche Breite haben (im Gegensatz zu
den COMBINING DIACRITICAL MARKS (0300-036F), die auf/unter einem Zeichen
sitzen sollen). Insbesondere:
- zu Breit: hochgestellte h, w und y
- viel zu schmall: T, _|_ und + (etc.)
- Zeichenbreite/Position im Block "COMBINING DIACRITICAL MARKS (0300-036F)
http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf
Bei den meisten Zeichen stimmt die Breite/Position, bis auf:
- 0306 COMBINING BREVE -> zu weit rechts
- 030B COMBING DOUBLE ACUTE ACCENT -> zu weit rechts.
- 0327 COMBINING CEDILLA -> viel, viel zu weit rechts!
- 0338 COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLY
-> Ich würde den Strich entweder etwas nach unten verlängern oder nach
etwas nach unten schieben; oder etwas nach links schieben? Jedenfalls
sieht "o" + U0338 (= ca. ø) komisch aus.
- Vielleicht ein klein bißchen zu weit rechts: 0323, 0330, 0331, 0342,
- 0384 GREEK TONOS -> Das Zeichen sollte normal breit sein und kein
"combining" Akzent.
- 03F1 GREEK LUNATE SIGMA SYMBOL = GREEK SMALL LETTER LUNATE SIGMA ->
Das Zeichen sollte anders als Sigma aussehen und zwar ohne den Bogen
unten (ca, wie "c", oft spitz zulaufend).
- 03F4 GREEK CAPITAL THETA SYMBOL -> anders als Theta, durchgehender
Strich in der Mitte
- 03F5 GREEK LUNATE EPSILON SYMBOL = straight epsilon -> Wie der Name
schon sagt ein nicht geschwungenes Epsilon. In der Physik benutzt man
oftmals beide Epsilons das gerade und das geschwungene.
(03F6 GREEK REVERSED LUNATE EPSILON = reversed straight epsilon -> bitte
das gedrehte 03F5 hinzufügen)
- 03F9 GREEK CAPITAL LUNATE SIGMA SYMBOL -> sollte anders als Sigma
aussehen, klassischerweise wie "C" (oft ohne Serifen und spitz zulaufend)

NUMBER FORMS
- 215F "1/ " -> Man sollte wohl die Breite so ändern, daß "1/" +
tiefgestellte Zahl (2080 bis 2089) gut aussehen.
> Durch Kerning gelöst

Fehlten:
- Griechisch-Block: 03DA-03E1 fehlen (Archaische Buchstaben)
http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0370.pdf
(Wieso die in MES-2 sind, weiß ich allerdings nicht)
* 03DA GREEK LETTER STIGMA

MATHEMATICAL OPERATORS, http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2200.pdf
- 2208 ELEMENT OF, 2209 NOT AN ELEMENT OF und 220A SMALL ELEMENT OF
-> das (Nicht-)Element-von-Symbol finde ich zu groß, es sollte nicht so
groß wie Versalien/Großbuchstaben sein, sondern so groß oder etwas
kleiner als Gemeine/Kleinbuchstaben. Das kleine Element-von-Symbol finde
ich zu klein.

Changes to version 2.1.1 regular(|) & italic(/) & capitals (20060729)

Changes to version 2.0.8 regular(|) & italic(/) & capitals (20060401)
- completely new bold version!

=> the family has therefore now finally all faces it classically needs, juhu! ;-)
-further small corrections in all faces
- I created TrueTypeInstructed variants of LinuxLibertine named "LinuxLibertine T" they can be therefore installed paralelly to the unhinted variants. 
Note 1: I recommend all users of OpenOffice 2.0.x on Linux to use the unhinted variants. On my linux-systems the unhinted variant is automaticly hinted and better looking than the hinted! On Windows-Systems -- nevertheless -- the unhinted variant is ugly on screen. Here you should take the instructed/hinted variant. 
Note 2: Hints (in the meaning of TrueTypeInstructions) do not have any effect on printing.

Anmerkung: Wenn man jetzt noch die Diacritical Marks verschiebt, dann verändern sie sich in allen anderen Akzentuierten Zeichen mit, wo sie durch Referenzen eingebunden sind. Daher habe ich die Verschiebungen ersteinmal nicht vorgenommen.
|Beim kleinen psi [03C8] kann ich mich nicht recht an den schrägen Mittelstrich     
  gewöhnen.)
| 1E48: Das _ beim N sollte wohl etwas länger sein oder etwas nach links
  verschoben werden
| Bei Greek Extended (1F00 bis 1FFF) ist bei 'E und 'H (allein und mit
  verschiedenen weiteren Akzenten) das ' vor der position 0,  und
  überschreibt somit das vorherige Zeichen. Das ist wohl nicht Absicht,
  oder? Analog bei `I (1FDA).
| uni2102: Das C (für die Menge komplexe Zahlen) sollte einen
  Doppelstrich haben, wie deine H,Q,Z,R
| 213D bis 2149: das gilt auch für die Zeichen hier (gamma, Gamma, Pi,
  Sigma, D, d, e und j)
| 2153 bis 215A: Die Brüche 1/3, 2/3, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1/6, 5/6
  fehlen; besonders 1/3 und 2/3 wären schön
| 2217 und 2218 sollten witer unten stehen (genaus so hoch wie das Minus
  und der Punkt 2219) da das Multiplikationsoperatoren sind.
| 226A und 226B: Das sind vielgrößer/vielkleiner Zeichen. Ich hätte sie
  aber so nicht erkannt. Nimm einfach << und >> und schiebe sie ein wenig
  ineinander.

Changes to version 0.2.6 (20030930)
- I overworked all serifs! The results are not visible in printing small sizes in TrueType
but since AutoHinting recognizes the serifs now we should have better printing results at
good postscript printers in PostScript-Fonts.
- Kerning table has been greately expanded even for pairs like ke, ka... Very sad that nearly all
Linux-TrueType programs don't care about the kerning table at all! This must change in future!

- C had major changes and satisfies me now.
- all numbers had some changes and got for the first all the same bearings left and right
- fi-ligature had complete redo, looks better but doesn't satisfies me, yet
- r got a little thicker nipple at the right end of its arm that leads to better printing an
recognition results at small points
